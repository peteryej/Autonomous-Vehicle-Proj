# Autonomous-Vehicle-Proj
This repository contains the Arduino code, final project report, and important reference materials for the scaled-down autonomous vehicle senior design project. It's a year-long four people team project. I worked extensively with Arduino boards and wrote C/C++ code to incorporate data from ultrasonic sensors, cameras, LIDAR, and GPS signals in order to make the vehicle move appropriately. Through this hands-on and challenging project, I gained precious team management and communication skills as well as technical expertise in embedded systems and real-time control systems. The reference for OpenCV document we used for machine learning in stop sign recognition can be found here, http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/objdetect/doc/cascade_classification.html. You can view the finished product testing video at this link, https://youtu.be/gGYnRD5SLcQ.
